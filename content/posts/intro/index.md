I recently realised that I had become an addict. To what ? How do I plan to recover ? What's the purpose behind starting this blog ? read on to find out


# Coming out as an addict
# And how to refactor your life around this addiction

##### Opium has never ceased to fascinate me

The more I read about this drug, the more light it throws on how it shaped the politics of the last Millenium. China is in the news for all the wrong reasons in 2020. But did you know that it was the victim of two Opium wars ?
Yes, a war over a drug. 
No, not a war to loot stashes of opium from the oriental treasures of China but to enable supply of Opium into China. 
Surprising isn't it ? 
Virtually all wars we hear of are fought to take something from a country. Then why would the British and the French attack the Chinese to give them something ?

When you dig deeper than the name of the war, you realise that the wars were not waged just for this one substance. Trade was not the primary motive for the attack (it was secondary). The main reason why the colonial powers fought this war was to destabilise the chinese society and bring down the Chinese Empire, one of the survicing two strong foes to western powers. The other was Japan, which stood tall until two nuclear bombs were dropped on it. 

How did one substance lead to the decline of the Mighty Ming Empire ? 
To understand its effects better let us take a closer look home

This is Jahangir, the fourth Mughal Emperor.  The Mughal dynasty ruled over virtually all of India. All rulers of this dynasty were males, with no record of any significant achievements by any woman associated with the court (plenty of documented crimes by the Mughals against women all over India but more on that in some other post). During Jahangir's rein however, a lady had a de facto control over all functioning for a large time period. How ? you may ask. It was because Emperor Jahangir was so addicted to Opium and alcohol that he was not in a condition to take any decisions. His wife Nur Jahan controlled all precdings. Since there's no record of a collapse of the empire, we'll assume she did a good job.

If a king with access to large riches, women and power could not control his cravings, what are we, the commoners to control ?

### Components of addiction
I attempt to break down addictions in 4 stages.
1. Cue
   1. An attack on your senses. 
   2. an event that gets detected by you 
      1. visually
      2. audibly
      3. sensually 
      4. etc
   3. some examples
      1. 50 % off signs
      2. boredom 
      3. notification of a new text by crush
      4. a secluded place in the nature
      5. something that reminds you of ex
2. Craving
   1. The feeling that you develop after the cue
   2. In the initial stages this feels like going against your rational side
   3. examples
      1. the wish to buy that item at 50% off sign.
      2. desire to smoke now that you're in a secluded place with frsh air
      3. searching for your phone when bored
      4. opening of text from notif even though you need to focus on work
      5. wanting to sit down for a drink when sad.
3. response
   1. the action that you perform in response to the craving
   2. over time these actions turn into habits
   3. ex
      1. purchasing anything thats at a discount even if u dont need it
      2. smoking up
      3. opening your phone.Specifically social media
      4. engaging in chat
      5. grabbing a quick beer
4. reward
   1. source of pleassure
   2. usually short term
   3. goes against long term gains
      1. feeling of ownership
      2. smoke/ drink reward
      3. feeling of being accepted in society (more friends , the better)
      4. feeling of being loved based off some kind texts

### Why these affect us
1. against long term gains
2. rewire your neural pathways
3. affect your health
4. affect your id

### We are being attacked.
Sometime in the last decade another war has been launched on us. It isn't limited to a country. The aggressor isn't a single party, rather a long list of them : a list which is rapidly expanding. They're not focing you to consume opium, (it's not possible to force feed a sane person abything other than cutlet pao.) They're attempting to feed you something exponentially more potent. Something that is tasteless, appears harmless and is being consumed by human beings ever since we developed conscience. 

We're being fed and made addicted to : information.

### Understanding information addiction

Throughout ancient and medieval societies, two things were in constant shortage : wealth and knowledge. Monarchs and leaders acted as the gatekeepers of knowledge.They were limited by the need of maintaining power from spreading wealth.Scholars and nobles (predominantly male) acted as the gatekeepers of knowledge. They were limited by the technology and traditions of those times from spreading knowledge. That changed with travel, socio-economic reforms and inventions like the prinitng press. A futher push was given by the advent of computers which enabled insights into domains previously unconquered by human capacity for computation. 

The biggest push to knowledge spread was given by the internet. I would argue it has played a role as large as all previous technlogies combined. As a result of which the environements in which we live are radically different from the times as proximus as even our parents generation. 

This has brought about a shift in how we consume knowledge 
1. Videos and tutorials instead of books
2. Twitter instead of newspaper
3. Group chats in place of  social outings
4. Artificial affection through apps, often limited to visual pleasures instaed of pristine intimacy with a loved one.
5. Performing a deed applauded in the society vs getting likes on social media.


The biggest differentiator is that we are no longer in control of the source of information. Our parents could decide which book they wanted to read, which ideology they would follow, which hobby consumed their time. We cannot. Gatekeepers of data are making those choices for us.

Here's how they get us hooked.
1. Cue 
   1. bombard you with notifications 
   2. attractive offers when u stop using
2. crbving
   1. every morning u feel like checking phone
   2. unrealistic expectations of receiving social acceptance or intimacy. Because, why wouldn't 20 people like the meme you shared, 
3. response 
   1. constant opening of phone
   2. social media updates completely replace other forms of self expression
   3. games replace sports
4. reward
   1. badges
   2. streaks
   3. photos

### the main motive is to shorten the time from  cue to reward while increasing the craving

### case study : me
I don't want to delve too deep into my own problems. You, the reader, are not here to be my therapist, I have one. Rather you're here to extract value yourself. Nevertheless I feel its my duty to reveal some hidden ways in which one can get addicted

1. The allure of the new
   1. finishing problem
   2. something appears on the horizon that you feel you should know
2. infinite scroll of life
   1. infinite scroll is a recent design paradigm
      1. designed to make it effotrless to discover new content
      2. seend in feeds
   2. applies to life as well. 
   3. There's so much data available that you forget how to stop and you keep scrolling through new info
3. Perfectionism
   1. others appear so much better
   2. u feel u need to constantly improve before u express urself
4. false sense of intimacy
   1. took long time to figure out what resonates with people.
5. false sense of accomlishment
   1. praise recieved by virtual friends or the leverage built there cannot translate into real world skills without pumping in efforts

### My plan to tackle
I cannot replace my info consumption addiction. The cues are still there. My job as a web developer and my hobby of quizzing ensure that I have to constantly sift through new information. I had to keep my phone switched off for 3 hours to draft this article but I cannot keep it off forever. 
What I intend to do is attack the cues and the rewards in such a way that it nudges my cravings and actions towards long term gains instead over short
That means
- outcome-independent work
  - blog as outlet
  - not for money
  - 
- Summarising books and publishing my insights instead of passively reading
- Using social media to ask questions and understand psychology of others instead of projecting my own views
- Using evenings as a hard stop of consumption 

### a booky formula for **success**

One of my all time favourite books: How to fail at almost everything and still win big is penned by Scott Adams, the creator of popular comic strip Dilbert. In the book Scott lays out a model of success by reverse engineering his life.

#### Sucees Model
-[ ] (convert this to diagram later)

1. focus on you diet. 
2. exercise and take care of your body
3. harness the energy from exercise to become more productive
4. once u optimize personal energy all u need is luck
5. cant directly cotnrol luck but u can inlfuence it by improving your strategy
6. choose startegy with better odds by understanding how the world works
7. for example combining two skills : psychology + ux desing + writing skills
8. keep sharpening ur skills until u compete in a smaller field which u can dominate
9. think of yourself as a robot instead of magic dust inside skin
10. if u control the input u can determine the o/p
