# Ending A Toxic Relationship

## Dear Comfort Zone

Thank you for keeping me safe from danger. Danger that  existed exclusively in my mind. Danger that, as it tuned out I should have confronted, faced and conquered. Danger that would have transformed me from a boy to a man. 

Thank you for not letting me take risks. Risks that my peers undertook, battled against and won. Risks that helped them design a life of their dreams. A life that lets them take on more rewarding risks. 

Thank you for not letting me unleash my potential. You were right, people would have mocked my initial attempts. You promised me you would find me a way which takes me from good to great without any judgment. You never delivered. 

Thank you for making a mountain out of a molehill in every new enterprise. For making me give up on the fruits  as soon as the  toil became hard. You said it would save my energy, it only decayed. 

I was born content. I was raised content. I was never the one to make a fuss when my demands were not met. The art of finding happiness in the tiniest places and things comes naturally to me. It's a trait I'm proud of. It's a trait that you exploited tp the fullest. 

### You never let me experience true desire, hunger or desperation. 
You deceived me into seeking happiness in half-assing. The glitter of superficial rewards promised by you kept me from loving the people I loved, from owning the things I wanted, from undergoing the experiences I looked forward to. You killed my passion whenever it arose. Suffocated my creativity and turned me into exactly the type of person I would be disgusted to become : mediocre. 

#### Not that I never experienced the pain:

Having practically no friends for around a year. 

Falling off the academic track at an alarming pace.

Deteriorating relations with close ones. 

Being dismissed in love as not serious enough. 

Losing the biggest contest of my life by a fraction of a second.

Forgetting my hobbies that bring me so much joy. (Most noticeably the hobby I'm practicing as I write this. )

##### Each time I failed to notice that the real problem was you

Each time you convinced me it was not my fault. That other people were too blind to see my problems, my efforts and my intent.
You never let me examine my shortcomings. Shortcomings that should have been obvious and are honestly  trivial to deal with. You ensured my first reaction to any big loss was detachment. I'm really grateful for that, I know many who are still wallowing in sorrow over something that should have buried into the past. But looking beyond that, you never let me ensure that those nightmares don't occur again. You kept me busy with the same old fallacies, peaceful in my ideal world. And those same old events recurred. The same old mistakes were repeated and the same old me remained detached from true pain.

### I've had enough. 
Not because I don't enjoy your company, I really do. But because I've realised there's far better company I can be in. 

Much better people who can push me to do my best. 

Much better projects I can take on. 

Much better skills I can master.

Much better hobbies I can pursue. 

## And those dangers you always spoke of ? 

Turns out I can't control them. I can't plan against all shortcomings. Heck! I can't even predict all shortcomings. I can't control how other people behave with me. How they receive my work and how much they accept me into their life. I am not as special as you told me I am. I need other people. I need their perspective, their motivation and their tough love, none of which I can obtain without being vulnerable. Turns out, none of them is special either. They have just learnt to be selfish, ruthless and to get out of their comfort zone. 

I want to imitate them. I want to learn their tricks. I want to walk in their shoes. I want to figure out how to achieve success. Only then can I live to my full potential. Not without these pre-requisites, as you promised. 

I have to be average before I become extraordinary. 

I have to talk to people before I charm them.

I have to love before being loved.

I have to express before I impress.

I have to fail before I succeed.

You promised me a springboard to success. All I was delivered was a bondage with failure. 

### I'm moving on. 
I won't talk about my next steps. I'll let my actions do the talking. Expect me to fail a lot and then bounce back up. As a man I've acknowledged two important lessons.

1. I can't control everything
2. I have to deliver a forthright effort towards everything that I do control.

This was supposed to be my first day free from you. A day full of industry, care and passion. You teamed up with your friend perfectionism to keep me away from industry. Thankfully I took time out for care and spoke to people that matter. People that in the past I've ignored under your influence. This act reminded  me that I'm loved. That I am needed. That I can cannot afford to remain in my comfort zone while there is so much suffering out there. People need to hear my story. People need to learn from my mistakes, and I'm going to teach them. One by one I'm going to unravel my bad traits and demonstrate how one can work around those and success. 

To achieve that, I can no longer afford to live with you. I'm sure we'll meet again. You'll find me when I'm fatigued or hurt. You'll offer me your poisoned chalice with an offer to free me from pain. Only this time I will be surrounded by people who'll protect me. Who'll keep me accountable and throw me right back onto the path of self realisation. I have to be vulnerable to them, not rest with you. I have to express my thoughts, not keep them tied to you. I have to start doing the things I love, with all the struggles attached. And that does not include you. I know what I am supposed to do next. The answers have always been right under my nose. I have a newfound vision to detect them : humility. I am a changed man now.

It's not you, it's me.
